String Calculator TDD Kata
--------------------------

This repository contains different session where I have worked on
Roy Osherove's String Calculator TDD kata.

This, the master branch, is a good starting point with a pre-configured
pom.xml file for maven to work.

Each new session will be a new branch. The readme in each will be notes
on progress.

The sessions are of different lengths and sometimes alone sometimes with
a partner.
