This is the second practice session. This time I've started
with what's in master, just created a new branch. Granted,
I allso have the IDEA project from yesterday so that setup
is smaller.

This is what I managed to do in 15 minutes. Learnt some
lessons from yesterday as well. And started to use a different
naming convention for tests. Not sure I'm alltogether pleased
with this one either though. But it's better.
